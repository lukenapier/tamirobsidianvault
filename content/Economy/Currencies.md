The following is a list of all the currencies in Tamir, the methods in which they are obtained, and the main uses for them.


## Tradeable Currencies

**Gold:**
	The primary currency used in shops, the grand exchange, received as monster drops, etc. Standard gold coin currency. There is no alchemy to generate gold, so it is somewhat rare. Earning 1,000,000gp is a prestigious accomplishment in Tamir. 

**Platinum Tokens**:
	Platinum tokens will be unavailable until reach a later phase in the project's roadmap. 
	Platinum tokens are the server's premium currency, and the primary method in which we will enable RWT, unlocking our vision of creating real world wealth in a virtual world. 

## Untradeable Currencies

**Grove Tokens**:
	Earned sporadically while woodcutting. Can be spent in the *Grove Token Exchange*.
