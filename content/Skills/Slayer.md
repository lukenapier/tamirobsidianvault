# Overview
Slayer is a *combat support skill*, in which experience is granted when player's kill non-boss monsters. *Most* attackable NPCs in the game are considered slayer monsters.
Different from how you might expect, a slayer task is NOT required to gain experience. 
Monsters give a tiny amount of experience, usually 25% of their HP (minimum of 1).

# Contracts
Slayer tasks can be assigned from Duradel in the Slayer Tower. These can be any creature on Tamir.
