The point is, Slayer sucks. The goal with this project is to make Slayer suck less. 
Some of the issues i'm thinking of are as follows;
	- getting tasks you don't like sucks
	- grinding low level tasks for point boosting kind of sucks but doesn't have to

With that being said, these are the changes that I am thinking of making.  This blog is still in it's very early stages, I am far from being complete with it. Everything is subject to change.

-Every kill awards a little bit of slayer exp, while completing a contract will provide a large boost.
-Slayer contracts can be receieved from Duradel, completing them will give much more experience than off-task grinding, as well as some slayer points. 

**Slayer Gear**
Hybrid Gear, good for all styles. This is a set of armor given to any who join the *Slayer's Guild*. Starting out it is tier 10 gear, and can be upgraded all the way to T80. This, alongside it's boosted stats to the slayer helm, makes it the BiS gear for any slayer task, as well as decent all-around gear when grinding off-task.
