The [[Woodcutting]] Rework will significantly alter the way woodcutting works compared to OSRS. 

Because we are adhering to our *pre-launch design philosophies*, we are putting ALL of the woodcutting content in one area, *The Woodcutter's Grove*

The Grove is the core point of interest in this project, obviously as it is the sole location we will be training woodcutting.

The goal of the Woodcutting Rework is that logs should be valuable, time spent gathering logs should be valuable, and upgrades that makes gathering logs faster should be very valuable.
There simply MUST be *afk* and *click-intensive* options.
