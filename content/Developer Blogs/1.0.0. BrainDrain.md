This is a list of things that I potentially want added, just a brainstorm of ideas REQUIRED before 1.0

- Audio
	- music
	- sound effects
- Achievements need to give rewards, and "achievement points"
	- achievement points are designed to replace "prestige perks"
- Quest System
- Improve Load Times
- MAP
	- home
	- ~~woodcutting area (grove)~~
	- mining area
	- bossing hub
	- 

**Snippets**:
- Display total level instead of combat level (togglable, auto changes in pvp and when in combat)
